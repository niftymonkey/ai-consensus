## Development Workflow

### Before Committing
**ALWAYS test that changes work before committing!**
- Run `pnpm build` to verify TypeScript compilation and build
- Have the user confirm functionality works
- Run the dev server and verify features
- Only commit after user confirms "it works" and any automated testing has completed succesfully

### Branching Strategy
- Create feature branches for all new work
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Keep commits focused and single-purpose

## Project Conventions
- Use TypeScript
- Use pnpm for package management
- Prefer single-line commits
- No emojis unless requested
